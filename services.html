            Having a website makes it very easy for people to find you, 
            read up about your company, discover what you do, and answer 
            a bunch of questions they have on your business. By having a 
            website people will be able to find your company when they 
            search for your company on a search engine like Google, 
            Yahoo or Bing.</p>

            With cloud computing, firms can free up resources 
            (including both financial and human resources) for 
            deployment in other areas. This allows them to devote 
            more attention to satisfying clients and customers, 
            rather than managing and maintaining their own IT 
            resources.</p>
